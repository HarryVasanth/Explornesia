# Explornesia
This repo contains the website design for the Explornesia Trilogy: Three individual games (Board, Digital and Hybrid) that we built within a month for the Game Design course taught by Prof. Sergi Berm√∫dez i Badia of the University of Madeira. We were also the finalists in the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.
